# Game Platform
## A Multi-platform to play many different Games for the game company called Fullerton Funhouse Inc.
Project description: We will make a plotform so we can play the companyâ€™s biggest hit games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Go Fish, Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, and Uno. To create fresh and modern gaming experiences to respond to market trends.
# Style Guide
We'll be using a linter called super-linter which is a linter that can be configured to lint the majority of languages and files types like Markdown and json, which in our case we'll mainly be focused on linting c# files.
